Please add your SaleMate project screenshot here:

1. Take a screenshot of your SaleMate website (https://salemate.netlify.app/)
2. Save it as "SalematePNG.png" in this folder
3. Make sure the image has a good resolution (at least 800x600 pixels)
4. The image should showcase the main features of your e-commerce platform
5. For best display, use a screenshot with a clean background or transparent PNG
6. The image will be displayed in "contain" mode to show the full image without cropping

This will ensure your portfolio displays your project properly and completely.
